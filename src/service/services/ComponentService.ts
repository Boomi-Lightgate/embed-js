     * Creates a Component object

     * - Request will not be processed in case if the payload has invalid attributes and tags under the <object> section.
     * - To create or update a component, you must supply a valid component XML format for the given type. The component XML can be rather complex with many optional fields and nested configuration. For this reason we strongly recommend approaching it by first creating the desired component structure/skeleton as you would normally in the Build page UI, then exporting the XML using the Component object GET. This will provide an accurate example or template of the XML you will need to create. You can replace values or continue that pattern as you need for your use case.

     * @returns Component Successful request and response.
