     * - To create a merge request, you need the branch IDs for the source and destination branches. The source branch is the branch you want to merge into the destination branch.
     *
     * - There are two merge request strategies you can choose from: OVERRIDE or CONFLICT_RESOLVE. An override merge automatically resolves any merge conflicts by prioritizing the branch specified in the `priorityBranch` field. If you choose the CONFLICT_RESOLVE strategy, you have the opportunity to review any conflicts and choose which version you want to keep.

     * Retrieves an instance of a MergeRequest object
     * Retrieve more information about the recently performed merge.

     *
     * -  OVERRIDE: The source branch has taken priority
     * -  KEEP_DESTINATION: The destination branch has taken priority
     * - The `changeType` parameter is generated from a branch diff that is performed on merge and can be one of the following values:
     * -  ADDED: A component was added to the source branch
     * -  MODIFIED: A component was modified in the source branch
     * -  DELETED: A component was deleted in the source branch

     * After performing a merge request between two branches, you can use the merge requestâ€™s ID to retrieve more information about the recently performed merge. The following example shows a merge between two branches where something was deleted in the source branch:
     *
     * Send an HTTP GET to `https://api.boomi.com/api/rest/v1/{accountId}/MergeRequest/{mergeRequestId}` where `{accountId}` is the ID of the authenticating account and `{mergeRequestId}` is the ID of the merge request.

     *
     * Send an HTTP GET to `https://api.boomi.com/api/rest/v1/{accountId}/UserAccountProperty/defaultWorkingBranch` where the `{accountId}` is the ID of the account for which you want to view the working branch.
